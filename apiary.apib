# PDK Panel API

The PDK Panel API provides for programmatic access to CRUD operations on entities and a realtime event stream from the PDK Access Control system.

The API conforms to many of the tenets of the REST style architecture and fully embraces the HTTP standard to fulfill many of these.

* Stateless
* Cacheable
* A URL identifies a Resource
* Operations conveyed implicitly through HTTP verbs

This drives certain uniform architectural attributes of the API.

> Where the documentation refers to `panel-id` this must be substituted with the actual serial number of your cloud node.
> If the cloud node serial number was 10702AG, then `panel-id` would be replaced with `panel-10702AG`.

# Authentication

Authenticating to this stateless API is handled by including an HTTP Authentication header in each request.
Before making any requests to the panel's API andpoint you will need a Bearer token.
This token represents your application's permission to access the API as delegated by the user.

For instructions on retrieving a token for communicating with a panel's API, see the [Auth Server API documentation](http://docs.pdkauthapi.apiary.io/). There are quite many libaries that support OpenID Connect protocol which is used for authentication. Please check [this link](https://openid.net/developers/libraries/) to see the list with some of them.

Because the API is stateless, this Bearer token must be included in every request to the API.
The Authorization header MUST be of the following format:

`Authorization: Bearer {token-value}`


# Resource Operations

Standard CRUD operations on resources are performed using HTTP verbs.

* GET - Retrieve a resource, never modifies data.
* POST - Create a resource. All required fields must be specified. In case when one of optional parameters is not specified, it's default value will be used.
* PUT - Update a resource. Requires whole resource body to be specified.
* DELETE - Delete a resource.


# Cache Headers

The current state of a resource is identified by standard HTTP caching mechanisms in the response to a requested resource (e.g. ETag, Last-Modified, cache-control).
These headers can be used for change detection and intermediate caching.

Most HTTP stacks (including your browser address bar) automatically deal with caching headers in a bandwidth, proxy, and user-friendly way.


# URI Format

Resource URIs will generally follow a format similar to those shown below.

* Resource Collection - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/{resource-name}`
Example - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons`
* Specific Resource - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/{resource-name}/{id}`
Example - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons/1`
* Related Resource Collection - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/{resource-name}/{id}/{related-resource}`
Example - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons/1/groups`
* Specific Related Resource - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/{resource-name}/{id}/{related-resource}/{id}`
Example - `https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons/1/groups/2`


# Pagination

Most of calls that return collections return paginated results in order to decrease panel server load 
(see `page` and `per_page` url query parameters).
Response contains link headers with links to first, last, next and prevous pages of results, 
which are specified in `first`, `last`, `next` and `prev` links accordingly.

For example, calling `GET https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons?page=1&per_page=5` will lead for the following headers:

```
Link: <https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons?per_page=5>; rel="first",
    <https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons?page=3?per_page=5>; rel="prev",
    <https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons?page=3&per_page=5>; rel="next",
    <https://panel-id.pdk.io/api/persons?page=2&per_page=5>; rel="last"
X-Total-Count: 11
```

# Content type

Content type is set to `application/json` for all API calls.


# Response Codes

## HTTP Codes
* `200` - OK status with JSON body
* `204` - OK status without body
* `400` - Bad Request
* `401` - Unauthorized
* `403` - Forbidden
* `404` - Not Found
* `422` - Unprocessable Entity
* `500` - Internal Server Error

## Error message format

Error messages provide human-readable description. For now only English language is supported, localization support will come in next releases.

    {
        "message" : "Human-friendly error message",
        "errors": {
            "field": "Human-friendly error message related to certain field (optional)"
        }
    }

# Metadata

*Introduced in API v1.6.3*

Certain updatable entities ([Person](#reference/persons), [Group](#reference/groups), [Devices](#reference/devices)) have a `metadata` property.
This property is opaque storage that can be leveraged by API consumers to store application-specific information.

A common use case is to store a correlation key that associates a pdk entity to an entity in the application database.

This property can be set to any valid JSON value, can not be null, defaults to an empty object `{}`, and there is a limit of 10KB on the size of the data stored here.

Once data is stored here, it will be provided with the entity any time it is retrieved via the REST API or sent in a message via the Stream Oriented API.

# Roles
Roles permissions have hierarchical structure. List of possible roles given below:
* `Reporter` has read only access for Persons, Groups entities.
* `Manager` in addition to `Reporter` permissions has write access for Persons and Groups entities.
* `Admin` in addition to `Manager` permissions has write access for Persons, Groups, System Events, Auto Open Rules, Floor Groups entities.
* `Integrator` in addition to `Admin` permissions can change hardware configuration (Devices, Connections, Config and Websocket API commands).
* `Sysop` in addition to `Admin` permissions can change hardware configuration (Devices, Connections, Config and Websocket API commands).

# Group Stream Oriented API

The stream-oriented API gives access to the main message stream of the panel.

This stream not only delivers event messages for state changes like credential scans, door opens, and data modifications, it can also be used to modify the state of the system by injecting command messages.

## Authentication

To authenticate to the event stream, a `token` parameter of a valid panel token must be set in the query string of the initial connection request to the root (`/`) URI.

An `error` message will be sent if the `token` is invalid or elided.

Since the panel token has a limited life, it must be refreshed once it has expired to continue receiving events. In order to refresh the token, a `renewedToken` message must be sent with a valid panel token specified in a solitary `token` parameter of the message body.

```
client.emit('renewedToken', { token: '<token goes here>' });
```

If a message is to be delivered for a connection with an expired token, the system will instead send `invalidToken` messages until the token is renewed. Once the token is renewed, the system will immediately deliver any messages that arrived while the token was expired.

## Message Format

Every message will have 2 manditory elements: `topic`, and `body`.

The `topic` uniquely identifies each type of message, as described later.

The `body` is where parameters for the message are contained and vary by message type.

```
{
  "topic": "message.topic",
  "body": { }
}
```

## Event Messages

Event messages are sent from the system when some state has changed. The topics of these messages are both the name of the message and are contained in the `topic` property of each.

### liveEvent

This message type represents a stream of audit events occuring in the system, including the audit message and any log parameters. This can be used to simply display human-readable event messages to users.

Unlike the other event messages, the `topic` property of this message correlates to the event type that caused the audit entry.

```
{
  "info": "DPS open has been detected on the device \"%s\".",
  "occurred":"2016-05-09 16:38:42",
  "topic":"door.input.dps.opened",
  "placeholders":[{

  }]
}
```

### door.request.allowed

```

## Command Messages

A `command` message can be sent to the stream to modify the state of the system. Commands are slightly different, as the message name `command` is always used for dispatching these messages while the `topic` contains the message topic.

```
client.emit('command', {
  id: '895f8d43-2279-4821-a0a4-2e16600a148d',
  topic: 'command.topic',
  body: { }
})
```

When a command is acted on by the system a `command.result.succeeded` message is sent, if a command fails then a `command.result.failed` message is sent.

The command message must contain a unique opaque `id` in order to correlate status response messages.

```
{
  "topic": "command.result.succeed",
  "body": {
    "commandId": "895f8d43-2279-4821-a0a4-2e16600a148d"  // The `id` of the command message
  }
}

}
```

# Group Reports

#### A report entity represents a filter for the audit log entries.

The functionality is available for all roles.
Partitions logic is applied to all operations.
[Reporter, Manager] can remove any entity from Report's details that is present there at the moment but they can fill Report's details only with entities that they have access to according Role and Partition restrictions.

# Group Partitions

#### A Partitions entity represents a filter for Person, Group, Floor Group and Device entities.
Partitions could be managed by [Sysop, Integrator, Admin] roles. Furthermore, listed roles can set Partition for entities that they have access to. In addition, there is a Default partition that could not be removed.

Person, Group, Floor Group and Device entities can not have no partition. Device can belong to several partitions at the same time.

Person's, Group's, Floor Group's and Device's partition is set to the User's partition during creation if another has not been passed. Listed above roles can change entity's partition during PUT query. To set Device's partition `partitions/devices` endpoint should be used.

If Device is bound to one Partition only and someone removes this Device from that Partition, Device will be transferred to the Default Partition. So Device should be bound to at least one Partition in time.

If User accesses the Panel and he is not bound to any Partition yet, his actions will be perceived as he is in the Default partition untill he will be explicitly bound to some other partition.
